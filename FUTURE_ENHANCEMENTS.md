# Future Enhancements

- Email / Teams integration: deliver reminders & escalations to real inboxes or chat channels.
- Role-based access: enforce RBAC so approvals can only be actioned by authorized users.
- Real SLA configs: per-department or per-vendor SLA settings.
- ERP / procurement system integration: sync approval requests from an external system.
- Multi-agent extensions: introduce separate agents for reminding, negotiating, and analytics.
